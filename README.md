## Rules to play

Instead a single deck for everyone run this program to build a group of 17 packs of 11 cards each.

Pack or put each pile turned down.

Run the drafting to build the deck. Each player will build its own deck with 35 cards.

Play the game as usual, when the rule say: Draw a card from City Deck, draw it from your own deck.

## Drafting methods

### Round robin

Each player choose a pile (in some order) until every player has the same amount of piles/packs

'''
4 players = 4 piles/packs
3 players = 6 piles/packs
2 players = 9 piles/packs
'''

Build a 35 card deck using these cards. Play as usual.

### Competitive

1. Pick the first pile/pack

2. The first player choose a card from it, the secong player pick a card from it, and goes on to no card left from first pile.

3. The next player will pick another pile/pack and choose a new card from it.

'''
4 players = Use 16 piles
3 players = Use 12 piles (or use 15 piles for stronger decks)
2 players = Use 8 piles (or use more piles, always even number for stronger decks)
'''

Remember that more piles takes longer for competitive building.

Is recommended 30 minutes for drafting and 15 minutes for deck building.

Some piles will not be used. That is ok. Leave it as secret, because it can make more challeging about the opponent deck content.
